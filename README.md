# ihategravel's Blocks

A collection of example blocks you can use for your own addons! Included in this repository is blocks made for current and future versions of Minecraft. Blocks will be updated to work with higher format versions as they come or even remade if a update brings a better way to do those block behaviors. 

# Are you allowed to use these blocks?
Simple answer, yes. As long as you attribute this repository on any Add-On websites such as mcpedl.com your welcome to use these blocks in anyway you like. What is NOT allowed is failing to attribute this repository or claiming that you are the owner/creator of such blocks.

# Case by Case Basis Situations:

Gametest - This repository is focused on creating all behaviors within the block file itself. Not all block behaviors an be perfectly replicated within the confines of a block file and Gametest can be very useful for such situations. If your block requires Gametest a decision will be made based on the situation and context.

Entities - As stated above, this repository is focused on creating all behaviors within the block file itself. If a entity is needed a decision will be made based on the situation and context.
